# 👨‍🎓 About Me

I’m a post-graduate student at Automation School, Beijing Institute of Technology, and received B.Eng. degree in Automation & Control, Shandong University (SDU). As a member of the State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Control and Decision of Complex Systems, I’m supervised by Prof. [Yuanqing Xia](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=HtedN3oAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Vice Prof. [Yufeng Zhan](https://ray-zhan.github.io/). 

My research interests include cloud resource management and Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), which aims to take machine learning models to production, and then maintain and monitor them.

**Sonnet:** A Control-Theoretic Approach for Resource Allocation in Cluster Management

**Ruifeng Ma,** Yufeng Zhan, Chuge Wu, Zehua Guo and Yuanqing Xia

- Existing methods cannot describe the internal mathematical expression between resources and performance, resulting in the inability to accurately give the amount of resource allocation under dynamic load conditions.
- We use a dynamic linearization approach to identify a model between resources and performance and minimize an objective function that controls error and resource cost.
