# üë®‚Äçüéì About Me

I‚Äôm a post-graduate student at Automation School, Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), and received B.Eng. degree in Automation & Control, Shandong University (SDU). As a member of the State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Control and Decision of Complex Systems, I‚Äôm supervised by Prof. [Yuanqing Xia](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=HtedN3oAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Assistant Prof. [Yufeng Zhan](https://ray-zhan.github.io/). I am active on [![Zhihu](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Zhihu-333333?style=flat&logo=Zhihu&logoColor=FFFFFF&color=0084FF)](https://www.zhihu.com/people/peak-81) & [![Bilibili](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Bilibili-333333?style=flat&logo=Bilibili&logoColor=FFFFFF&color=FF69B4)](https://space.bilibili.com/269154813?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0) & [![Github](https://img.shields.io/badge/-GitHub-333333?style=flat&logo=GitHub&logoColor=FFFFFF&color=000000)](https://github.com/RuifMaxx) to share my *Blogs & Life & Codes*. ***I love to make friends. So if you want to say hi, I'll be happy to meet you more!***

My research interests include cloud resource management and Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), which aims to take machine learning models to production, and then maintain and monitor them. 

<!-- # üè∑ Projects

**Sep. 2022 - Jun. 2023: Intelligent Scrap Steel Grading System(Participate) Supported by the [China Unicom](http://www.chinaunicom.com.cn/index.html)** 

- Responsible for Building a Machine Learning Operations System on a Serverless Platform.

**Nov. 2020 - Jun. 2021: Multi-dimensional Time Series prediction based on Deep Learning.** Undergraduate research project thesis. Earned 119 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/RuifMaxx/Multidimensional-time-series-with-transformer). Achieved grade A. 

- Learned Generative Models (VAE, FLOW, GAN). Identified the disadvantages of existing models in modeling long sequences. I replaced the decoder of TPA model with GRU to build GRU-TPA model and combined the advantages of MQ-RNN and self-attention to build the MQ-Attention model. -->

[Efficient Hardware Realization of SC Polar Decoders Using Compound Pipelined Processing Units and Auxiliary Registers](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3364384)

2024, IEEE Access

Yasir Ali, Yaunqing Xia, Tayyab Manzoor, Shahzad Ali, Mohamed Abouhawwash, S. S. Aakar, Amit Krishan Kumar and **Ruifeng Ma**

[Paper PDF](https://sim.ppeak.site/files/access-2024.pdf) ÔΩúDOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3364384

<!-- Polar codes have garnered substantial research attention due to their impressive performance characteristics and have found applications in recent technologies. However, the existing SC decoders suffer from lengthy processing latencies due to their sequential processing steps, thereby restricting the practical applicability of polar codes. To address this latency issue, this paper introduces a compound pipeline processing unit and its simplified counterpart. -->
